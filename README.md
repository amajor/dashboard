# Dashboard

This will be my dashboard project as I work through the process of setting up and deploying a product. It will be an application that presents useful information to the user.

## The Plan

### 1. User Personas

The user personas that will keep me centered on the appropriate minimum viable product (MVP) can be found in [Dashboard Application Project](https://github.com/amajor/dashboard/projects/1), used for basic project planning.

### 2. User Stories

To be created.

### 3. Build It

Use test driven development (TDD) to deliver code that I can have confidence in.
